# Number Munchers Reborn

# A simple number-munchers-like game

This started off as a simple project to do on an airplane, but people liked it, so I took it from
something made with an HTML `<table>` and vanilla JS to a more well-supported Angular app with graphics 
and sound.

I don't own the copyright to Number Munchers, but all the code is original, and it's different enough, experience-wise,
that it's fair to put an MIT license on it.

## Setup

* `npm install`
* `ng serve` for a development server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 
* `preplocal.sh` or `deploy.sh` to build for production
